In this project, you’ll learn how to build an API without managing traditional servers. 
Instead, you’ll harness the power of AWS Lambda and Amazon API Gateway to create a fully serverless architecture.

This project is especially valuable for roles like Backend Developer, Cloud Architect, or Systems Engineer,
where understanding serverless APIs is a key skill for building scalable, cost-efficient applications.

In this project, you’ll:

- Develop a serverless Lambda function — the logic behind your API.

- Configure an API with API Gateway — define endpoints and routes.

- Connect Lambda with API Gateway — make your API live and callable.

- Write JSON documentation — describe and share your API with othe

Three-Tier Architecture — Project 2

This is the second project in our three-part series on building applications with three-tier architecture.

Three-tier architecture organizes applications into three essential layers: presentation, logic, and data.

In this project, you’ll focus on the logic tier — the application’s backend. This is where your code lives, handling user actions (like button clicks) and transforming them into meaningful functionality (such as running a search, processing data, or generating results).
