In this project, you’ll learn how to build an API without managing traditional servers. 
Instead, you’ll harness the power of AWS Lambda and Amazon API Gateway to create a fully serverless architecture.

This project is especially valuable for roles like Backend Developer, Cloud Architect, or Systems Engineer,
where understanding serverless APIs is a key skill for building scalable, cost-efficient applications.

In this project, you’ll:

- Develop a serverless Lambda function — the logic behind your API.

- Configure an API with API Gateway — define endpoints and routes.

- Connect Lambda with API Gateway — make your API live and callable.

- Write JSON documentation — describe and share your API with othe
